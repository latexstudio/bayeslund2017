	\frametitle{Some lessons learned}

	\begin{itemize}

		\item Delving into mathematical details, e.g. derivations of formulae for posterior distributions, did not prove to be very effective.
		\item Learning by building and running Jags models proved much more effective.
		\item Being comfortable with R is vital. Pre-workshop R bootcamps were popular and effective.
		\item Software installation problems can stymie progress.
		\item For many, Bayesian data analysis means Bayesian hypothesis testing (with Bayes factors). While for me, Bayesian data analysis means flexible probabilistic modelling.
		\item The age of Bugs/Jags has (probably) passed, Stan is now the preferred choice.

	\end{itemize}

	\frametitle{Recommendations for the future syllabus}

	\begin{itemize}

		\item Introductory workshops: The essence of Bayesian data analysis and Bayesian hypothesis testing.
		\item Intermediate level workshops: Regression modelling, i.e. linear, general linear, generalized linear, multilevel regression.
		\item Advanced level workshops: Nonlinear regression, latent variable modelling, mixture modelling, time series modelling.
		\item More Advanced level workshops: Causal modelling, structural equation modelling, Bayesian neural networks, Bayesian deep learning, Bayesian machine learning.
